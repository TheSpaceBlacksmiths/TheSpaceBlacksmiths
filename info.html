                        The products we are presenting are designed to be as ecological as possible, in fact through the use of a technology already developed by NASA, the Refabricator, it would be possible to produce, even in space, a series of components which will compose the astronaut's space suits gadgets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        As the Refabricator works as a 3D printer, but with the possibility of using recycled materials, such as plastic polymers and polymer alloys, producing the gadgets would be easy, economic and ecologic! It has already been estimated that generally the shipping cost of about a kilo of material is around 20.300 dollars, and with the use of this technology the price is drastically reduced!

                        Our space gadgets would be mainly composed of recycled plastic, and recycled metals recovered from space junk, as parts of old vehicles which are still in the Earth orbit. Even if all the metals recovered would be sent to earth to be recycled, will compose the most important parts of our products, as the bootâ€™s spikes, or the ionic propulsion tank, as well as electrical circuits.
